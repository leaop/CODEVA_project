# Task 3 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊

## 📁 Dataset: Students Performance in Exams

This project analyzes the performance of students in three subjects: Math, Reading, and Writing, using data collected from 1000 students.

## 🔍 Objectives

- Compute summary statistics (mean, std, median, etc.)
- Visualize distributions via histograms and boxplots
- Explore relationships using scatterplots and correlation matrix
- Segment performance by gender and test preparation course

## 📊 Key Features

- Dataset size: 1000 entries
- Categorical variables: gender, race/ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, test preparation
- Numerical variables: math score, reading score, writing score

## 📦 Tools Used

- Python
- pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📄 Outputs

- `eda_students_performance.pdf`: visual EDA report
- `students_descriptive_stats.csv`: summary statistics
- `students_correlation_matrix.csv`: correlation values

## 📌 Insights

- Gender-based score differences were visualized.
- Strong correlation found between reading and writing scores.
- Boxplots reveal variability among groups.
